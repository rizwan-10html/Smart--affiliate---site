## What I've Implemented

### 🔥 Core Features

1. **Automatic Facebook Posting**: When you add a product to any category, it automatically creates a complete Facebook post

3. **Professional Post Format**: Posts include product images, descriptions, prices, and relevant hashtags
4. **Category-Specific Hashtags**: Different hashtags for different product categories
