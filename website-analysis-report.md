# Website Analysis Report - Page Inconsistencies

After analyzing your website, I've identified significant inconsistencies between your homepage and several other pages. Your homepage has a modern, professional design with "SmartDeals Pro" branding, while other pages still use an older design with different branding and styling.

## Homepage (index.html) - ✅ Modern Design
- **Professional branding**: SmartDeals Pro
- **Modern header**: Uses `.main-header` class with professional navigation
- **Complete layout**: Hero section, featured products, categories, testimonials, newsletter

- **Modern styling**: Uses Inter font, proper color scheme, and modern CSS
